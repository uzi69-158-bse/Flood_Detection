Flood Detection Segmentation with ResNet-18
This project implements flood detection using satellite imagery by performing semantic segmentation with a modified ResNet-18 architecture. The project leverages deep learning techniques to classify each pixel in the image as either flooded or non-flooded. The model is trained, tested, and deployed in a Dockerized environment to ensure reproducibility and efficient execution.

Project Overview
This project performs semantic segmentation to detect flooded regions in satellite images using a ResNet-18 architecture. The model is trained on satellite images, and it outputs a segmentation map that classifies each pixel as either flooded or non-flooded.

Key objectives:

Implement a machine learning workflow for flood detection using semantic segmentation.
Use ResNet-18 as the backbone for feature extraction.
Utilize transfer learning for improved model accuracy.
Deploy the model in a Docker container for easy reproducibility and deployment.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

Open a terminal window and run:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flood-detection-segmentation.git
cd flood-detection-segmentation
Install Dependencies
Before running the project, install the required dependencies. It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment to manage these dependencies.

Create a virtual environment:

Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

Run:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt should contain the necessary libraries such as torch, torchvision, numpy, opencv-python, PIL, matplotlib, and docker.

Docker Setup
This project is dockerized for reproducibility. If you prefer to run the project in a Docker container, follow these steps:

Build the Docker image:

In the project root directory, run:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t flood-detection-segmentation .
Run the Docker container:

You can run the Docker container interactively with:
bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm flood-detection-segmentation bash
This will open a bash shell inside the container where you can run the training and inference scripts.

Model Architecture
The core model for flood detection is built using ResNet-18 as the backbone for feature extraction. The model is modified for semantic segmentation by replacing the fully connected layers with a Conv2d layer that outputs pixel-wise predictions.

Training and Inference
Training
To train the model on the flood detection dataset, run the train.py script. Ensure that you have a dataset with images and corresponding masks for training.

Specify the path to your data directory, number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate when running the training script.
Inference
Once the model is trained, you can run inference on new satellite images to predict flooded areas:

Provide the input image path and output path for the predicted segmentation mask.
Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the trained model, you can use metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) or pixel accuracy. The evaluation script computes these metrics to assess the modelâ€™s performance on a test set of images.

Using Docker
For a seamless environment setup, you can use Docker to build and run the project in a container.

1. Build the Docker image:
go
Copy code
```bash
docker build -t flood-detection-segmentation .
```
2. Run the Docker container:
To run the container interactively: bash docker run -it --rm flood-detection-segmentation bash

Inside the container, you can execute the Python scripts (train.py, inference.py, etc.) as usual.
